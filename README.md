Welcome to my project on predicting campus recruitment outcomes using Logistic Regression! In this project, I've trained a Logistic Regression model on the Campus Recruitment dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to forecast whether a student from 'XYZ' college will be placed or not based on historical data.
Logistic Regression is used for binary classification where the target variable has two possible outcomes. Despite its name, it is used for classification rather than regression.
I have leveraged GridSearchCV for fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model. Additionally, I also delved into power of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) which is used to generate synthetic samples of minority class in case of Imbalanced datasets to enhance the performance of the model.
 
Please share your thoughts and suggestion.
Thank you for checking out my work!
